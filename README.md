# code-casefile README

The *code-casefile* extension allows the Visual Studio Code editor to read, modify, export, import, and share casefiles -- hierarchical collections of advanced bookmarks.

## Features

### Casefile Bookmarks

A casefile bookmark is not just a file path and line number.  Each bookmark includes:

* The text selected for the bookmark
* The original line number on which the text was found
* The file path within the project
* Associated, user-editable notes
* For projects with Git source control, the commit and line number in which the bookmarked line was added to the project

Additionally, casefile bookmarks can be organized as child bookmarks of other casefile bookmarks, creating a bookmark hierarchy.
